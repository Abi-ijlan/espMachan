aim
to design a automated irrigation system by using ESP32 microcontroller.

tool will be used
1. ESP32
2. solenoid valve 

objectives
1. should open the valve at exactly at 5.00 PM
2. should be closed by 5.05 PM

phase 1
sending a signal from esp32 to out at a desired time.

need to learn
1. NTP Protocol https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-time-protocol-ntp/
2. learn how to connect esp32 with wifi
   1. search for the available network
   2. connect to the available network
4. taking time using NTP protocol.
